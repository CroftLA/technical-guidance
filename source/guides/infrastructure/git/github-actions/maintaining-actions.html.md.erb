summary: Using Dependabot to keep Github actions up to date
---

#  <%= current_page.data.title %>


GitHub actions are generally supplied by the Marketplace and can occasionallly become out of date. To help prevent this you can use the GitHub Dependabot tool.

This is based on the documentation provide by GitHub Dependabot

Create or amend the .github/dependabot.yml file and add in the following section:

```
version: 2
updates:
  # Maintain dependencies for GitHub Actions
  - package-ecosystem: "github-actions"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "daily"
```
A more complete file for a ruby project could look like:


```
version: 2
updates:

  - package-ecosystem: bundler
    directory: /
    schedule:
      interval: weekly

  - package-ecosystem: npm
    directory: /
    schedule:
      interval: weekly

  - package-ecosystem: docker
    directory: /
    schedule:
      interval: weekly

  # Maintain dependencies for GitHub Actions
  - package-ecosystem: github-actions
    directory: /
    schedule:
      interval: daily
```
