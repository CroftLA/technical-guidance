#  <%= current_page.data.title %>

ACT is a useful tool allowing you to run GitHub Actions from your command line, prior to having to check them into GitHub and run them on the server.

## Installation
To install follow the instructions at [nektos/act]( https://github.com/nektos/act )

* offers installation options using brew, chocolatey

## Tips
To use secrets you will need to use the Shell export command and create environment variables for example:

```
export GOVUKPAAS_USERNAME=<GOVUKPAAS_USERNAME>
export GOVUKPAAS_PASSWORD=<GOVUKPAAS_PASSWORD>
export DOCKERHUB_USERNAME=<USERNAME>
export DOCKERHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<DOCKERHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN>
```

Then you are able to run the act command line; from the root of the cloned repository:

```
pwd
/Users/dummy/dfe/get-into-teaching-api

act -s DOCKERHUB_USERNAME -s DOCKERHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN -s GOVUKPAAS_USERNAME -s GOVUKPAAS_PASSWORD
```

If your action refers to the commit SHA, you will need need to supply this as an environment variable before running the act command


```
vi test.env
<< GITHUB_SHA=ad46c15da83d85b9f97d7bbcbac6f2fc3e24efa7

act --env-file test.env -s GOVUKPAAS_PASSWORD ...

```
