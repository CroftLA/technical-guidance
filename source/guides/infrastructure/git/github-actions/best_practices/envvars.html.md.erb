Variables can be declared at the workflow level, or job and step level. Avoid declaring secrets at a global level if it can be done at more local level.

Environment variables are available as:

* workflow variable: ${{ env.MY_VAR }}
* shell variable inside run: run: echo ”$MY_VAR”

Use the second form in run when possible but be careful as the variable won’t be expanded.


```
env:
  TEST_DIR: $HOME/app/tests         # Contains a variable which should be expanded
...
    steps:
    - name: Check test directory
      run: |
        echo "$TEST_DIR"            # $HOME is not expanded
        echo "${{ env.TEST_DIR }}"  # $HOME is expanded

```
