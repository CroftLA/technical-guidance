summary: UK GOV PaaS billing details 
---

GDS charges for our usage and sends us an invoice every 3 months. The cost is typically the cost of AWS resources plus 10% admin fee.

The bill is sent to DfE Digital finance. It is then split between the different services depending on usage per space.

Costs are available at the organisation level and at the space level. A service should aggregate usage across all their spaces to calculate the total cost.

## Access to billing
The billing data is available in the paas portal. To be able to access it users must have BillingManager role at the organisation level.
