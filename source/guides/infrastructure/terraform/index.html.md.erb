summary: Terraform allows deploying infrastructure in a declarative way with an elegant syntax. It uses different providers for each type of infrastructure
---

## Usage
Terraform uses different providers for each type of infrastructure. In Teacher services we use it for:

 * Azure
 * AWS
 * StatusCake
 * Cloud Foundry

## State
Terraform keeps a register of all the resources it has created so it can keep them under control. We need a persistent storage for that. It should be provided by using an IaaS solution. Depending on the team, we use:

* Azure storage accounts
* AWS S3

Since the state is critical, we strongly recommend using versioning. This allows restoring the state in case it’s deleted or restoring a previous version in case it’s corrupted or updated by mistake (new terraform version for instance). Enable in Azure storage or S3.
