## Install the CLI

Follow these [instructions]( https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli )

## Versions

The version of Terraform used by GitHub Actions' Ubuntu 20.04 image is v0.13.0.

When installing Terraform locally it is important to make sure you have a version that matches the Github version, or you can cause state files to not be compatible.

### Pin the version in a GitHub Actions workflow:

```
    - name: Pin Terraform version
      uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v1
      with:
        terraform_version: 0.13.1
```
        
### Pin the version in Terraform code (e.g. versions.tf):

```
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 0.13.1"
}
```

### Install a matching version locally

To allow you to manage multiple versions locally, it is suggested you install tfenv

```brew install tfenv```

### List remote available versions:

```tfenv list-remote```

### Install a specific version:

```tfenv install 0.13.1```

### List all versions which are installed locally

```tfenv list```

### Use a specific version:

```tfenv use 0.13.1```
