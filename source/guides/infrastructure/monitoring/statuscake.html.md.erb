#  <%= current_page.data.title %>

Statuscake is a cloud based tool used to constantly monitor the availability of websites and alert when they are not present. 

## Access
Statuscake can be accessed by creating an account at [https://www.statuscake.com](https://www.statuscake.com/) using your @digital.education.gov.uk email address. 

This will not give you access to the projects, for that you will need to contact <%= digital_tools_support %> and request access to the **DFESTATUSCAKE** subaccount.

## Delivery
Although manual configuration of a 'Uptime Monitoring Test' is possible we recomend that delivery is via terraform and uses the following sample:

```
provider "statuscake" {
  username = local.infrastructure_secrets.SC-USERNAME
  apikey   = local.infrastructure_secrets.SC-PASSWORD
}

alerts = {
  GiT_App_Production_Healthcheck = {
    website_name  = "Get Into Teaching Website (Production)"
    website_url   = "https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/healthcheck.json"
    test_type     = "HTTP"
    check_rate    = 60
    contact_group = [185037]
    trigger_rate  = 0
    confirmations = 1
    custom_header = "{\"Content-Type\": \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\"}"
    status_codes  = "204, 205, 206, 303, 400, 401, 403, 404, 405, 406, 408, 410, 413, 444, 429, 494, 495, 496, 499, 500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 505, 506, 507, 508, 509, 510, 511, 521, 522, 523, 524, 520, 598, 599"

  }
}

terraform {
  required_version = ">= 0.13.4"

  required_providers {
    statuscake = {
      source  = "StatusCakeDev/statuscake"
      version = "1.0.1"
    }
  }
  
  resource "statuscake_test" "alert" {
  for_each = var.alerts

  website_name  = each.value.website_name
  website_url   = each.value.website_url
  test_type     = each.value.test_type
  check_rate    = each.value.check_rate
  contact_group = each.value.contact_group
  trigger_rate  = each.value.trigger_rate
  confirmations = each.value.confirmations
  custom_header = each.value.custom_header
  status_codes  = each.value.status_codes
  basic_user    = local.infrastructure_secrets.HTTP-USERNAME
  basic_pass    = local.infrastructure_secrets.HTTP-PASSWORD
  test_tags     = ["GIT", "BETA"]
}
```

### Contact Group
Disapointingly the statuscake terraform provider does not supply a method to create contact groups, this will need to be manually created in the statuscake GUI and the CUID is required.

#### Alerts
It is possible to have a number of emails and mobile numbers for alerts when a site is unavailble.

#### Integration 
It is possible for a SLACK message to be raised, but you will need a SLACK Webhook, which can be provided on request by <%= digital_tools_support %>
