## Slack Alerts
Alerts in logit.io can be configured to be sent to various applications, in this case we want to send our Errors to Slack.io

### Configure Slack
You will need to have administrator access to a Slack workspace to create an Incoming Webhook or ask <%= digital_tools_support %> to provide you one.

In the Apps area of your workspace, you will need to add the Incoming Webhook App. 

Configure it to use the channel you require, and capture the web hook it provides, as shown in the example below:

```
https://hooks.slack.com/services/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
```

### Create an Alert
A word of caution, I set this all up on my own Slack account first to test it. It can cause a swarm of Slack messages

Return to logit.io and in the Settings/Alerts menu, you will be able to create a new Alert or amend an existing alert.

Here you need to create your alert; for example:

```
name: Test App Errors

type: any

index: logstash-*

filter:
- query:
    query_string:
      query: "syslog_severity:error"

## Receive an alert for every single match
realert:
  minutes: 10
  
generate_kibana_link: true

# (Required)
# The alert used when a match is found
alert:
- "slack"

## Live alerts channel
slack_webhook_url:
- https://hooks.slack.com/services/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
```
