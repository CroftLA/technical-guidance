#  <%= current_page.data.title %>

The Logit platform delivers  a fully customised log and metrics solution based on Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana which is scalable, secure and compliant. It is the recommended method of cloud hosted logging when using the <%= uk_gov_paas %> .

## Access
Logit can be accessed by creating an account at [https://logit.io/](https://logit.io/) using your @digital.education.gov.uk email address. 

This will not give you access to the project stacks, for that you will need to contact <%= digital_tools_support %> and request access to TWD stacks.

* Becoming a Teacher - PAAS
* Get Into Teaching

## New Stack
To create a new a new stack you need to raise a request with <%= digital_tools_support %>, providing them with the directorate ( Teaching Workforce Directory: TWD ) and project name. You will need to know the approximate amount of data and retention period. (This can be gathered from [Logit.io](http://logit.io/) )

The digital tools support team will liaise with finance. This process can take a couple of working days.

## Log Structure 
All teams should send the logs using a similar structure so the queries, graphs and dashboards can be reused across different products.

This assumes a typical Rails application as it’s the vast majority in Teacher services.

* Use [Logit.io](http://logit.io/) to store and query logs
* When using <%= uk_gov_paas %>:
	* Send logs to STDOUT
	* <%= link_to "Configuring Rails logger for GOV.UK PaaS", "logit/rails_logger.html" %>
* When using Azure:
	* Use logstash-logger gem to send logs to [Logit.io](http://logit.io/) (we don’t have a method to send STDOUT logs to logit in Azure, so have to rely on logstasher running in the docker container)
* Use [rails semantic logger](https://logger.rocketjob.io/) to make logs pretty
