## Podcast

For an overview of GOV.UK PaaS and how it is used in Government, head over to the
[GDS podcast](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2021/03/31/podcast-gov-uk-platform-as-a-service/).

## Suitability

[Azure CIP](/guides/default-technology-stack/#azure) is the traditional platform for hosting services in DfE. When does it make sense to use GOV.UK PaaS?

### Standard web applications

GOV.UK PaaS runs applications in horizontally scalable, stateless Linux containers. It is not adapted to large stateful enterprise applications.

It is mainly aimed at [12-factor applications](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/architecture.html#12-factor-application-principles), which is a set of
good practices for web applications to ensure smooth operations, scalability and consistency across environments. The service manual
[recommends](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/deploying-software-regularly#managing-variable-configuration) this architecture.

Native Windows applications will not run. However, .NET Core is supported as it runs on Linux.

### Rapid development

The traditional Azure platform may require specialised engineers and more time to set up and manage. GOV.UK PaaS provides the
ability to spin environments up/down without infrastructure expertise, enabling prototyping and fast iteration, which is particularly useful in
Discovery and Alpha. Some teams use [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) to deploy a prototype quickly. GOV.UK PaaS provides similar features but government
hosted and cheaper.

Also, it allows short lived environments created for the unique purpose of validating a new feature, similar to
[Heroku review apps](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration-review-apps). This allows for ephemeral/temporary environments to be
created and disposed "on the fly" and removes the contention usually observed when sharing environments.

### Low cost

GOV.UK PaaS is particularly adapted to services with budget constraints as total cost is lower than full IaaS. Cost of hosting is usually lower than
Azure but most of the savings will come from the lower dependency on dedicated infrastructure engineers.

Specialist engineers may still be requested on an ad hoc basis for guidance and to make sure the application is production ready.

### Simple infrastructure

Setting up a web application in the cloud involves a significant number of non-functional requirements such as providing internet access, container
scheduling, load balancing, scalability, monitoring, user access management, billing etc. A platform-as-a-service
[includes them already](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/overview.html) so the developer doesn't have to implement them.

As a result, setting up an application does not require full time infrastructure specialists or ops engineers. However, the set-up is limited to what
is available in the platform: see [application development](https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk/application-development/) and
[constraints](https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk/constraints/).

A limited number of [backing services](https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk/application-development/#backing-services) are provided: PostgreSQL, MySQL,
Redis, Elasticsearch, AWS S3, and InfluxDB. They run in the platform and cannot be accessed externally but can be easily linked to your application in
a GOV.UK PaaS container.

Application logs and performance metrics are [available in the platform](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/monitoring_apps.html#monitoring-apps) in
standard format and can be accessed manually, via the web portal or via external tools. The platform itself doesn't provide log storage or custom
visualisations.

### Security: Up to OFFICIAL data

The platform is [assured for use at OFFICIAL](https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk/security/#our-safety-measures). As the data owner for a service
[you must ensure that appropriate controls are in place when handling Official data](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/official-sensitive-data-and-it).

The platform is multi tenant: the resources are shared between different users and each one has dedicated access to the resources, with clear access
control policies. Users are other government departments. Some very specific applications might require total isolation which the platform does not
provide.

### Connectivity: Internet only

The platform runs in a public cloud: inbound and outbound connections are exclusively via public Internet. Traditional network based security via
dedicated network links, VPN, IP restrictions cannot be used.

Instead, transport security is achieved by using HTTPS/TLS and authentication via username/password or a single-sign-on integration such as with
OAuth or SAML (DfE Sign-in is supported), or several types of API authentication. This is handled at the application level. This is a "cloud first"
approach as specified in the Technology Code of Practice.

### Suitability Matrix

To review the comparison of features and capabilities of both Azure platforms and Gov UK PaaS, see the
[Suitability Matrix](govuk-paas-suitability.html).

### Customer Journey Map

[customer journey map](govuk-paas-customer-journey.html).

## Organisations and spaces
To separate users, applications, services and ultimately costs, GOV.UK PaaS provides
[organisations and spaces](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/orgs_spaces_users.html#managing-organisations-spaces-and-users).

<%= image_tag('orgs_and_spaces.svg', alt: 'Org and spaces in DfE') %>

### Organisations
DfE manages a GOV.UK PaaS organisation called `dfe`.

### Spaces
Developers in each service should have a space to push apps and services. Each space represents one or more environments for a service. For example,
service "abcd" may own spaces "abcd-dev", "abcd-staging", "abcd-production". Naming of spaces is not mandated but should be explicit.

Each space may have a different set of user permissions as developers in mature teams should not be able to push to production manually, unless
explicitly given permission to. Ideally only CI/CD systems should be able to make changes in production. Developers in a service don't have access to
another serviceâ€™s applications, unless explicitly given permission, on as granular a basis as required.

### Management
Management of the platform is done by GDS. Management of the DfE resources is done by the Infrastructure operations team:

* Create/Delete spaces
* Add/Remove users to the platform
* Set users roles on spaces
* Designate "space manager" users who are responsible for adding/removing users to their spaces
* Designate "billing manager" users who are responsible for the spaces bills
* Invoice the finance team responsible for each space
* Create DNS domains

## Billing
GDS charges for our usage and sends us an invoice every 3 months. The cost is typically the cost of AWS resources plus 10% admin fee. See [Pricing](https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk/pricing/).

The bill is sent to DfE finance. It is then split between the different services depending on usage per space. Each finance team is sent the invoice for cross-charging.

Costs are available [via the portal](https://admin.london.cloud.service.gov.uk/organisations/386a9502-d9b6-4aba-b3c3-ebe4fa3f963e/statements) at the organisation level and at the space level (BillingManager role required to access).
A service should aggregate usage across all their spaces to calculate the total cost.

A dashboard showing daily spending is available by default when the [cf-monitoring](https://github.com/DFE-Digital/cf-monitoring/) solution is deployed.

## Exploring GOV.UK PaaS
If you are interested in adopting this platform and would like to explore it, request a new user. By default you will be given access to
the _sandbox_ space where you can deploy anything on a temporary basis. Please be mindful that creating resources is not free so you should delete them as soon
as possible.

Requests are raised via [the service portal](https://dfe.service-now.com.mcas.ms/serviceportal/?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=0659b8c81bc7a0502fe864606e4bcb63&sysparm_category=19d07bc3dbff17003b929334ca9619bd).
An `@education.gov.uk` account is required, as well as [access to the service portal](https://dfe.service-now.com.mcas.ms/serviceportal/?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=09927632dbe6d0509402e1aa4b9619b5)
for BYOD users.

If you can't access the service portal, someone who has access can raise the request for you.

Finally, you can ask in the `#govuk-paas` Slack channel or via email to [infrastructure operations](mailto:infrastructure.operations@education.gov.uk).

## Onboarding a service
If you are planning to use GOV.UK PaaS in production, you will need one or more spaces (See [Organisations and spaces](/how-to/hosting/govuk-paas/overview/#organisations-and-spaces)),
dedicated to your service.
Finance must be agreed as you will be responsible for the bills. The required details are shown on the service portal form.

## Adding a user to the platform
Any DfE user with an _@education.gov.uk_ or _@digital.education.gov.uk_ address can have an account on the platform. By default they will have access
to the sandbox space only. Access to particular spaces can also be requested, but it is preferably provided by the existing space managers.

Here are the space roles available:

* *SpaceManager*, only for managers, senior developers, tech leads or devops engineers
* *SpaceDeveloper* for developers. Only for non-production spaces.
* *SpaceAuditor* for readonly access

And one organisation level role:

* *BillingManager* to access billing data and current spending
