## Temporary privileged access
To allow rapid response to incidents, privilege escalation is done by the space managers. It is currently a manual process and they are responsible to
revoke the privilege when it is not needed anymore. It is possible to
[run a script](https://github.com/DFE-Digital/bat-infrastructure/blob/main/scripts/check-users-in-space-developer-role.ps1) regularly to confirm we
only see the expected space users.
