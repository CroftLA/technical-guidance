Service accounts are user accounts on various systems like GOV.UK PaaS, Github, Azure usually required by automation. They are not related to a human user to avoid the risk of stopping
the automation when the user is offboarded. This requires shared credentials so care should be taken to be able to share them in a secure way.

- For non email based credentials like Azure service principals, add the keys to the production [keyvault protected by PIM](/how-to/security/managing-secrets).
- For email based credentials like GOV.UK Paas, Github, Dockerhub, a useful pattern is to use a shared email. It provides a unique email address used to register the account agains the system. The human owners of the service accounts are made members of the shared email
and are able to reset the password. See below.
