# DfE Technical Guidance

How we build and operate products at the Department for Education. This repo
is inspired by (and steals shamelessly from) the [GDS Way](https://gds-way.cloudapps.digital) and the
[Ministry of Justice Technical Guidance](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/technical-guidance/#moj-technical-guidance).

It's built using the GOV.UK [tech-docs-template](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-template), and hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

## Getting started

To preview the site locally, we need to use the terminal.

Install Ruby and [Bundler][bundler], preferably with a [Ruby version
manager][rvm].

[rvm]: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/#managers
[bundler]: http://bundler.io/

Once you have Ruby and Bundler set up, you can install this project's
dependencies by running the following in this directory:

```bash
bundle install
```

## Making documentation changes

To make changes edit the source files in the `source` folder.

Although a single page of HTML is generated the markdown is spread across
multiple files to make it easier to manage. They can be found in
`source/documentation`.

Make sure to make changes in a branch, and issue a pull request when you want them to be reviewed and published.

## Previewing

Whilst writing documentation we can run a middleman server to preview how the
published version will look in the browser. After saving a change the preview in
the browser will automatically refresh.

The preview is only available on our own computer. Others will not be able to
access it if they are given the link.

Type the following to start the server:

```
bundle exec middleman server
```

If all goes well something like the following output will be displayed:

```
== The Middleman is loading
== LiveReload accepting connections from ws://192.168.0.8:35729
== View your site at "http://Laptop.local:4567", "http://192.168.0.8:4567"
== Inspect your site configuration at "http://Laptop.local:4567/__middleman", "http://192.168.0.8:4567/__middleman"
```

You should now be able to view a live preview at http://localhost:4567.

## Build

If you want to publish the website without using a build script you may need to
build the static HTML files.

Type the following to build the HTML:

```
bundle exec middleman build
```

This will create a `build` subfolder in the application folder which contains
the HTML and asset files ready to be published.

## Publishing changes

Because we're using GitHub Pages, any changes merged into the `master`
branch need to be published by running `bundle exec middleman build` and pushing to the `gh-pages` branch. This is configured in the repository's settings under Options -> GitHub Pages where the branch is set to `gh-pages` and the folder to `build`

The above can be automated,

Every change should be reviewed in a pull request, no matter how minor, and we've enabled [branch protection][] to enforce this.
