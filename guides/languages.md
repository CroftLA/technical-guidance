# Programming / scripting languages in use within DfE

As we await recruitment of our Head of Software Development profession,
a group of enthusiastic and likeminded individuals from across Digital, Data and
Technology thought it would be a good idea to document the programming and scripting
languages in use across the DfE and its Executive Agencies.

The list below provides a place to gather this information. We hope that developers,
tech leads, technical architects and anyone else that has an interest will help
us build the 'as-is' list. Feel free to comment on the related
[Github issue](https://github.com/DFE-Digital/technical-guidance/issues/35) or
make suggestions direct on the
[programming-languages](https://github.com/DFE-Digital/technical-guidance/tree/programming-languages)
branch.
